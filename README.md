# 🧪 Home Lab – IT Support & Systems Practice

This repository documents my **technical Home Lab**, created to **practice, simulate, and document real-world scenarios** related to IT support, networking, operating systems, and infrastructure services.

The main focus is **structured troubleshooting**, similar to what is required in real Help Desk, IT Support, and System Administration environments.
